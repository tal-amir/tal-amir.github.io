I am writing to apply for a research associate position, which I believe will be instrumental in advancing my research goals and career in Dr.~Nadav Dym's group at the Technion. Since joining the group in December 2021 as a postdoctoral fellow, I have been engaged in research that aims to shed theoretical insights and develop practical means to facilitate machine learning, and deep learning in particular, on irregular data such as sets, point clouds, and graphs.

Our research is at the forefront of this rapidly growing field, driven by ongoing efforts in the community to harness the power of deep learning for crucial applications involving such data. Examples include 3D shape analysis, molecular property prediction, and novel drug discovery. This goal poses unique challenges, as traditional deep-learning methods cannot be directly applied to such data. To unlock the full potential of deep learning for these tasks, it is necessary to develop new theoretical frameworks and algorithmic tools.

Our efforts have already produced five papers published in top-tier venues, with some presenting groundbreaking results and solutions to long-standing open problems. For example:

- The results in our paper [1], published in the leading deep-learning conference NeurIPS (spotlight paper, top 3\%) bridge the gap between architectures used in the theoretical study of neural networks, which have beneficial theoretical properties but are not suitable for practical use, and the architectures used in practice, which lack theoretical guarantees. In the same paper we also highlight a fundamental limitation in the most prevalent methods to handle geometric data.
- In our recent paper [2], currently under review, we developed a method that overcomes the aforementioned limitation, demonstrates superior performance in our preliminary experiments, and has the potential to serve a wide range of applications in our field. Additionally, we established an impossibility result that shows that a highly sought-after goal in machine learning on geometric data is in fact unattainable -- thereby saving the community further efforts in that direction.

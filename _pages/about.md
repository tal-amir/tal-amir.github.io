I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Nadav Dym](https://nadavdym.github.io)'s group at the Faculty of Mathematics, Technion Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.

My research interests encompass machine learning and optimization, with a focus on developing mathematical tools and practical algorithms that enable deep learning on data types with inherent symmetry structures, such as sets, point clouds, and graphs.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Boaz Nadler](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/Nadler/home) at the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in the Weizmann Institute of Science.

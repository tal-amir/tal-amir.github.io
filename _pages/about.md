I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Nadav Dym](https://nadavdym.github.io)'s group at the Faculty of Mathematics, Technion Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.

My main research interests are machine learning and optimization, focusing on the development of mathematical tools and practical algorithms to facilitate deep learning on data types that have an inherent symmetry, such as sets, point clouds and graphs.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2020 under the supervision of [Prof. Boaz Nadler](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/Nadler/home) at the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in the Weizmann Institute of Science.

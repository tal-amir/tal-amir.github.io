- [Sparse Approximation by the Generalized Soft-Min Penalty](https://github.com/tal-amir/sparse-approximation-gsm)  
  Solver for the sparse approximation / best subset selection problem.  
  Matlab, C

  Part of our paper titled "[*The Trimmed Lasso: Sparse Recovery Guarantees and Practical Optimization by the Generalized Soft-Min Penalty*](https://tal-amir.github.io/publication/2021-09%20The%20Trimmed%20Lasso)"  
  
- [Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein (FSW) Embedding](https://tal-amir.github.io/soon/)  
  Efficient code to compute the FSW embedding â€” a Euclidean embedding for multisets and measures, which is bi-Lipschitz on multisets and injective on measures  
  PyTorch

  Part of our paper titled "[*Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein Embedding for Multisets and Measures*](https://tal-amir.github.io/publication/2024-05%20Fourier%20Sliced-Wasserstein%20Embedding)"
  
- [Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein Graph Neural Network (FSW-GNN)](https://tal-amir.github.io/soon/)  
  A graph neural network based on the FSW Embeding, which computes a bi-Lipschitz Euclidean embedding for graphs, which generalizes and maintains injectivity on weighted graphs  
  PyTorch Geometric

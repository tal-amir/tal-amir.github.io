- [Sparse Approximation by the Generalized Soft-Min Penalty](https://github.com/tal-amir/sparse-approximation-gsm)

  Solver for the linear sparse approximation problem, also known as best subset selection.
  Matlab, C

  Part of our paper titled "[The Trimmed Lasso: Sparse Recovery Guarantees and Practical Optimization by the Generalized Soft-Min Penalty](https://tal-amir.github.io/publication/2021-09%20The%20Trimmed%20Lasso)"
  
- [Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein (FSW) Embedding](https://tal-amir.github.io/soon/)

  Efficient Python code to compute the FSW embedding - a Euclidean embedding for multisets and distributions

  Part of our paper titled "[Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein Embedding for Multisets and Measures](https://tal-amir.github.io/publication/2024-05%20Fourier%20Sliced-Wasserstein%20Embedding)"
  
- [Fourier Sliced-Wasserstein Graph Neural Network (FSW-GNN)](https://tal-amir.github.io/soon/)

  A graph neural network based on the FSW Embeding, which computes a bi-Lipschitz Euclidean embedding for graphs, which generalizes and maintains injectivity on weighted graphs
